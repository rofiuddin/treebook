# This model initially had no columns defined.  If you add columns to the
# model remove the '{}' from the fixture names and add the columns immediately
# below each fixture, per the syntax in the comments below
#
#one: {}
# column: value
#
#two: {}
#  column: value
#In order to write some tests, we need to make sure certain data is available to us without logging in. fixtures takes care of that
